I want to see if I played blackjack about how often I would win depending upon where my limit for hitting was placed. The dealer has to be set at 16 because thats how the house is forced to play but every other player including yours can be set to have a limit. I plan on having some form of card counting AI as well later one after I do the main features first.

Also planned is to have a fully playable regular game of blackjack playable in command line.
